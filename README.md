# CRUD Galaxy

The taste of CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) on SvelteKit. This is an implementation of how to CRUD on SvelteKit using Laravel programmer's mental model.

## How to run?

1. Clone this project.
2. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to create environment variable. I keep it default because I use Sqlite 3.
4. Run `pnpm run db:push` to create database using provided schema.
5. Run `pnpm run dev` to taste CRUD. Have fun.
